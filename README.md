## FAQ

**What's the difference between a WordPress theme and a page builder?**
A theme controls the overall look and feel of your site (layout, typography, colors). A page builder is a plugin that lets you create custom page designs with a drag-and-drop interface. Many modern themes, like Divi, have a builder built-in.

**Can I change my theme later without losing my content?**
Yes, your posts and pages are saved in WordPress, not the theme. However, changing themes will reset your site's design and layout, so you'll need to set up the new theme's styles, which can be a significant amount of work.

**Is a free theme good enough to start with?**
Absolutely. Many free themes like Astra or Kadence are incredibly powerful. Paid themes usually offer more advanced features, pre-built templates, and dedicated support, which can be a huge help as your site grows.

## Conclusion

Your WordPress theme is the engine of your website, and choosing the right one can make all the difference. While any theme on this list can produce a beautiful site, it's about finding the tool that best fits your workflow. For a truly integrated experience that combines a powerful theme with an intuitive visual builder, [Elegant Themes (Divi)](https://elegantthemes.com) remains a top choice for creating professional websites with ease.
